ideas:
Weakness potion - attacks do 1.5x damage for 2 turns
poison potion - does -10 to -20 damage every turn
posion cure -  cures poison
lighter fule - lights weapon on fire for 5 turns, does x1.3 damage

water type enemy (could be named different) - immune to fire attacks
fire type enemy - inflicts fire damage but is more suspectable to explosive attacks (does more damage from fire)
